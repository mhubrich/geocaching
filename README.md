## What is Geocaching?
Geocaching is a global treasure hunt of people looking for caches, or hidden stashes of objects. It is a series of hide-and-seek games, where hiders provide online clues for seekers. Seekers use GPS devices to find hidden caches.

Caches are the hidden treasure. Geocachers look for coordinates (the longitude and latitude) of caches. Caches have two or three parts: a waterproof container, a logbook to list the people who visit the cache, and sometimes a low-cost trinket or geocoin.

Geocaching has evolved from a small hobby to huge, well-organized treasure hunts for people of every age and ability. There are nonprofit organizations, as well as businesses for geocaching. The largest is [geocaching.com](https://www.geocaching.com/).

## What is this repository about?
There are many different [kinds of geocaches](https://www.geocaching.com/about/cache_types.aspx). The puzzle (or mystery) cache involves solving a puzzle to determine the correct coordinates of the hidden cache. This repository provides scripts to solve some of these puzzles. Why using a programmatic approach to solve these puzzles? Because we can! And it's fun :smile:
